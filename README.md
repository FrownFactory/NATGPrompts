# NATG Prompts
[**Click here to get your prompt**](https://frownfactory.github.io/NATGPrompts/ "Click me")

Get a random prompt from Equestria Daily's Newbie Artist Training Grounds.  
A simple javascript for simple people.

Download **"randomprompt.html"** for a standalone, offline version of the prompt picker.  
Note: this one doesn't contain the randomized prompts. But it does have the terrific design of the online version.
You can also download that file under ["releases"](https://github.com/FrownFactory/NATGPrompts/releases "Releases").

You can use *"randomprompt.js"* in your own projects, it comes with a whooping 2 functions:
- **getRandomPrompt()** returns a random prompt
- **getTotalPrompts()** returns the total number of prompts

The prompts themselves are defined in the *prompts* const, you can add / remove prompts as you like.


You can use *"generateprompt.js"* in your own projects, it comes with a grand total of 4 functions:
- **getRandomAdjective()** returns a random adjective / adverb or other descriptor for the character
- **getRandomVerb()** returns a random verb / some sort of activity or circumstance for the character
- **getGeneratedPrompt()** returns a complete prompt using the two aforementioned functions
- **getPossiblePrompts()** returns the total number of possible, different prompts

the descriptors are defined in the *adjectives* const, the activities in the *verbs* const, make of that what you will.
